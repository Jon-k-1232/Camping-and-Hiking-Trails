# Camping-and-Hiking-Trails
The way this api is used is it pulls trails, and camp sites from REI's camping project web api. The flow starts with required user input the input is then put through google Geo to get the latitude and longitude so that the api web address for the api's can be created. One the lat/long is obtained from google it must be converted to lat/long abbreviations that REI recognizes. Two separate endpoint api's run, one for campsites, and another for trails. This creates two flows in order to manipulate the DOM. Once the DOM is manipulated for the requested information the array of data that was returned from REI is then split and put into new arrays containing data to place back in google maps to create markers.
Issues encountered mainly pertain to the setup of the visual expectation of google markers. Additionally it was found the REI API does not have pictures to go with every trail or camp spot.
